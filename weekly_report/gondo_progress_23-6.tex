\begin{itemize}
    \item Revise bachelor thesis, especially examine the noise contained in the signal.
    \item After the BPF was applied, the wavelet reconstruction was carried out.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Noise contained in the signal}
To see if the frequencies attributed to the heartbeat were extracted, I used the Welch method to examine the frequency response.

\end{figure}
After wavelet reconstruction, the overall power was lower, and the power in the 0.6-2 Hz frequency band, which is the frequency of a heartbeat, and the power in the higher frequency band were similar.

\subsection{Try BPF + Wavelet Reconstruction}
Since the frequency response after wavelet reconstruction did not extract well the 0.6-2 Hz frequency band corresponding to the heartbeat frequency band, the BPF was applied before wavelet reconstruction.

On the Keio Hospital dataset, which consists of 12 subjects, we achieved 93.82\% accuracy under the close-set condition(Cross-validation is not performed). The confusion matrix is shown below.

\section{Next Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pass BPF after applying Wavelet Reconstruction
\end{itemize}
