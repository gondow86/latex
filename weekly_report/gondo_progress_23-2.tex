\section{Progress}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Check the accuracy using ellipse fitting and wavelet reconstruction under close-set and open-set condition.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The data are segmented by 5 seconds, with an overlap of 1.5 seconds. All predictions are made for every single segment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{A Result under close-set condition}
\subsection{Only applying ellipse fitting}
I got 18.21\% by just applying ellipse fitting under close-set condition.

\subsection{Applying wavelet reconstruction after applying ellipse fitting}
I got 83.41\% by applying ellipse fitting and wavelet reconstruction under close-set condition.

\section{A Result under open-set condition}
I got 44.06\% by applying same preprocessing method above under open-set condition. Six subjects' data were used in training, the other six in testing only. In fig. 2, Label 6 indicates unknown people.

\section{Next Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As you can see from the figure below, I think wavelet reconstruction has a role to remove undesired frequency band signals, I will confirm the effectiveness of wavelet reconstruction by comparing it with ellipse fitting and BPF application.
\end{itemize}
